Project Plan : Small library management system


This document is the project plan for the small library management system developed for the Waterfall group assignment by Savina Vinwath, Yasiru Gimhan and Vimukthi Bandara. 


Problem statement :

Small libraries manage book records and issuing manually, which makes it difficult to quickly check book availability and track issued books accurately.

Objectives :

	To develop a simple Library Management System for managing books
	To allow the librarian to check book availability and issued status
	To demonstrate the traditional Waterfall SDLC process
	To understand the impact of strict phase sequencing

Scope :

	Add book details
	View list of books
	Issue a book to a member
	Return an issued book
	Search a book by ID to check availability

The system will not support- due dates, reports, user authentications, outside database.

Assumptions :
 	
	The system will be used by one librarian
	Data is entered carefully
	No need for third party access

Constraints :	

	No database
	Limited developing time
	For the simplicity, we will only use HTML and JavaScript
